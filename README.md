Full Stack Web Application for Events Management System
Application developed by utilizing React.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
The project aimed to serve Managers during creating and managing events, collaborating with other employees and getting statistical data such as Weekly Report, Monthly Report, Event cost, Food cost and Employee cost.
 As a full stack developer, I designed, built, implemented and tested all interfaces and key features of this project. For front-end interfaces I implemented Material UI library components, Redux Store states management library. For back-end I developed APIs using Express.JS and integrated the MongoDB database to store and manage task-related information.
Successfully deployed the web application on Heroku hosting platform ensuring high availability and scalability.
